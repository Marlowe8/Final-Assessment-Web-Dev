                    insurance, we will happily bill it for you. Determining the cost of a visit when you use
                    insurance is quite difficult as each policy can have a different co-payment, co-insurance or deductible, and our
                    contracted rates vary with every insurance contract. Copayments and co-insurance are due at the time of service,
                    but frequently we have to bill the insurance and await a statement from them called an explanation of benefits
                    to determine what you owe. Once we receive the explanation of benefits from your insurance, any remaining payment is due.
                </p>

                <p>
                   To help those who are uninsured receive access to affordable health care we offer a discount program for patients
                    without insurance.
